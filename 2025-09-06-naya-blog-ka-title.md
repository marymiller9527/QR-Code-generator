Have you ever wondered how that small, black-and-white square image can be so powerful? We're talking about QR codes. You see them everywhere now—on products, menus, business cards, and even on advertisements. But did you know you can create your own QR code? And it's completely free and easy!

What's the Magic Behind a QR Code?
QR stands for Quick Response. They were designed to let you access any information in a second, without typing anything. Imagine you want to share your website address. You don't have to write the full URL. Just let someone scan your QR code, and they will be taken directly to your website.
What can you use QR codes for?

Business Cards: Put your contact details, email, and LinkedIn profile into a single QR code. Your clients can simply scan it to save all your information.


Restaurant Menus: Forget paper menus! Place QR codes on tables so customers can access your online menu.
