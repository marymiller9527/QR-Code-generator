A Complete Guide to QR Codes and Their Benefits

What is a QR Code? A QR code, short for "Quick Response" code, is a two-dimensional barcode. Unlike the simple barcodes you see in a grocery store, a QR code can store information both horizontally and vertically. This allows it to hold a much larger amount of data in a small space.

How Do QR Codes Work? When you scan a QR code with your smartphone camera, the phone instantly reads the information hidden inside. This information can be anything, such as:

A link to a website


A short text message


A Wi-Fi network password


A contact's phone number or email

The biggest advantage of a QR code is its speed and convenience. You don't have to type long website addresses or complex information. With just one quick scan, the job is done.
